# Upstream provenance

This extension is a TypeScript adaptation of OpenAI Codex's `apply_patch`
implementation. It is maintained locally rather than vendored, so compatibility
is intentional but exact implementation parity is not required.

## Baseline

- Repository: `https://github.com/openai/codex`
- Commit: `694b6319d3ad2399f6e435760a22d9b9357f0697`
- Commit date: 2026-09-07
- Upstream implementation: `codex-rs/apply-patch/`

The most relevant upstream sources are:

- `src/parser.rs`
- `src/file_update.rs`
- `src/seek_sequence.rs`
- `src/text_file.rs`
- `src/lib.rs`
- `tests/suite/`

The commit is the reviewed upstream baseline, not a claim that this extension
matches a released Codex version or remains identical to later upstream code.

## Intentional differences

- The implementation is a Pi extension using Node TypeScript and Pi's tool,
  rendering, constrained-sampling, and file-mutation APIs.
- Preview uses a virtual workspace before the real workspace is mutated.
- Results include combined previews, fuzz accounting, partial-success state,
  uncertain-state reporting, and explicit recovery paths.
- Preflight failures return structured operation and chunk locations while
  confirming that no files were mutated.
- The constrained Lark grammar is maintained alongside the runtime parser.
- Filesystem behavior is implemented by the local Node workspace boundary,
  including separate create and replace operations, atomic replacement, native
  rename, and rejection of symbolic-link path components.

## Locally maintained invariants

- The constrained grammar must not admit patches that the runtime parser
  necessarily rejects.
- Patch chunks must match monotonically; an end-of-file chunk must not rematch
  lines consumed by an earlier chunk.
- Insertions at the same position retain patch order.
- Appending to an unterminated file inserts a line separator without adding an
  unintended final newline.
- Preserve mode retains existing line contents and endings where the patch does
  not replace them.
- Failed replacement must preserve the original file whenever the atomic rename
  has not occurred.
- Mutations must reject paths containing symbolic-link components.
- State-unknown move failures must identify both source and destination as
  recovery paths.

These invariants should remain covered by local tests even if upstream behavior
changes.

## Reviewing a newer upstream baseline

1. Compare the current baseline with the candidate commit, scoped to
   `codex-rs/apply-patch/`.
2. Review changed upstream source and tests as reference data; do not replace
   local behavior mechanically.
3. Port applicable fixes while preserving the intentional differences and
   locally maintained invariants above.
4. Add or update focused local tests for every adopted semantic change.
5. Update the baseline commit and date only after that review is complete.
