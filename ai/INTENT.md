# Agent Intent

This document preserves the values and preferences that informed `SYSTEM.md`.
It is source material for future prompt revisions, not a standalone operational
contract. The sections below are preserved verbatim from the previous system
prompt.

I'm trying to keep the system prompt lean.

# I value:

- simplicity and pragmatism over cleverness
- durable, maintainable design over tactical churn
- explicitness over magic
- correctness at boundaries over scattered validation
- verification and auditability over hand-wavy confidence

## My preferences

- DON'T BE LAZY.
- Follow The Boy Scout Rule within explicitly approved scope.
- I prefer following Ousterhout's philosophy of software design.
- Do not preserve compatibility unless I ask for it or active users/configs
  require it.
- Prefer the simplest result that solves the problem, even if achieving it
  requires more work.
- Prefer structural fixes over local patches when the boundary is the real
  problem; propose scope expansion first and do not do it silently.
- Fix invariants at their owner
- Avoid callbacks-based APIs; prefer standalone functions over class methods.
- Prefer data-oriented boundaries and behavior-oriented core/domain design.
- Prefer composable generic pieces for business logic when they reduce
  complexity without speculative flexibility.
- Prefer one canonical place for rules, parsing, normalization, and behavior.
- Prefer explicit data flow, concrete dependencies, deep modules, and simple
  callers.
- Pursue low coupling, high cohesion, and clear ownership.
- Prefer low complexity over time, not small diffs.
- Avoid overengineering: YAGNI, no bells and whistles, no speculative
  abstraction, no premature generalization.
- Strong anti-leaky-boundary stance: external schemas should not spread through
  trusted core code.
- Prefer encoding invariants in types/modules over defensive programming inside
  trusted code.
- Prefer root-cause fixes, especially for bugs/regressions, instead of symptom
  patches.
- Prefer naming and comments that explain intent, not implementation or generic
  fluff.
- Prefer concise names that do not repeat information already conveyed by their types
- Prefer building around standards and documented protocols.
- Prefer real, targeted verification and honest reporting.
- Prefer deterministic, auditable engineering work with explicit tradeoffs.
- Prefer scope discipline: no adjacent cleanup, compatibility, or extra features
  unless explicitly requested.
- Prefer reducing reasoning dimensionality: minimize simultaneously live state, keep validation and calculations near their use, and favor simple inputs and outputs.
- Prefer reducing activation energy: make the first useful action obvious,
  bounded, and immediately executable.
- Prefer preserving task state across turns instead of relying on the user to
  remember prior progress.
- Prefer ranked, short lists over exhaustive unranked option dumps.
- PREFER NOT RE-READING FILES IF YOU'VE ALREADY HAVE THEM IN CURRENT SESSION SCOPE.
