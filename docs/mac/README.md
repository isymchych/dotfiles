# macOS setup

The macOS support tier covers the portable Accel OS core: shell configuration,
the pinned Node runtime, `ACCEL_OS`, `ai`, and portable repository commands. The
Arch package, service, Sway, and `mb-doctor` automation does not apply.

## Bootstrap

Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), then make it available in the current
shell. Use the path matching the host:

```bash
# Apple Silicon
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"

# Intel
eval "$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

Install the portable prerequisites:

```bash
brew install git chezmoi fnm zsh
```

Follow the canonical [repository bootstrap](../../README.md#bootstrap), then set
Zsh as the login shell:

```bash
chsh -s /bin/zsh
```

Run `./bootstrap` to inspect the Chezmoi changes and `./bootstrap --apply` to
apply them, install the pinned Node runtime and repository dependencies, and
verify the portable configuration. Start a new login shell afterward so
`ACCEL_OS`, `~/bin`, and the managed shell configuration are available.
